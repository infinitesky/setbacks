(Steve Jobs was fired from his initial role at Apple, after all, and Anna Wintour was fired from an editorial role at Harper's Bazaar. Being fired doesn't mean the end of your career.) Don't dwell on it, since that won't help your situation. Instead, focus on what you are going to do next and how you are going to find another job. Keep in mind that another hurdle - the stigma of being fired - has just been added to your job search.

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Thomas Edison:</b> Thomas Edison secretly conducted experiments in his office at Western Union that got him fired.Until one night in 1867, when he had a chemical accident at the Associated Press bureau news wire, according to Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials.Edison worked the night shift so he could have more time to spend on his inventions and reading. One night when he was experimenting with batteries, Edison spilled some sulfuric acid that ate through the floor and spilled onto his boss's desk below.He was fired the next morning, but decided to pursue inventing full-time and received his first patent two years later for the electric vote recorder, according to Biography.com.</li>
	
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Steve Jobs: </b>Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, the company he co-founded. His second act turned out to be bigger and better than the first.
When Jobs was in his 30s, the company he created fired him."I was out--and very publicly out," Jobs said in a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. "What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating." Jobs spent the summer of 1985 in a "midlife crisis" trying to decide what he wanted to do, from entering politics to becoming an astronaut, said Alan Deutschman, author of The Second Coming of Steve Jobs. During his time away from Apple, Jobs co-founded computer company NeXT, which was later acquired by Apple, and launched Pixar Animation Studios. When he returned to Apple nearly a decade later, he brought the innovation of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.</li>

	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Walt Disney:</b> Walt Disney's newspaper editor told the aspiring cartoonist he wasn't creative enough. In 1919, Disney was fired from one of his first animation jobs at the Kansas City Star newspaper because his editor felt he "lacked imagination and had no good ideas," according to The Wisdom of Oz. That wasn't the last of his failures. Disney then acquired Laugh-O-Gram, an animation studio he later drove into bankruptcy. Finally, he decided to set his sights on a more profitable area: Hollywood. He and his brother moved to California and began the Disney Brothers' Studio, eventually creating Mickey Mouse and Disneyland and winning 22 Academy Awards.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Mark Cuban:</b> In the 1980s, Mark Cuban lost his job as a salesman at computer store. That was the last time he worked for someone else.One of Cuban's first jobs out of college was as a PC software salesman. However, he was more interested in cultivating new business than obeying his boss. Cuban wrote in Forbes that, after a few months on the job, he had to opportunity to make a $15,000 sale-- he just needed a co-worker to cover him at the office and to get his boss's approval. After his boss told him not to make the sale, Cuban decided to go through with it anyway, and upon returning to the office with the check was promptly fired. "But being fired from that job was the determining factor in my business life," he wrote. "I decided then and there to start my own company." Shortly after his termination, Cuban started Micro-Solutions and has since earned an estimated $3 billion, according to Forbes.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>J.K. Rowling:</b> J.K. Rowling spent too much time at work brainstorming story ideas. Rowling worked as a secretary for the London office of Amnesty International, but she dreamed of being a writer. She secretly wrote stories on her work computer and daydreamed about a teenage wizard named Harry Potter. Her employers finally got fed up and gave her the boot, according to Your Journey from Fired to Hired. Her severance check helped support her over the next few years, when she finally decided to focus on writing. Today, she's the author of one of the most successful book series of all time.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Michael Bloomberg:</b> Michael Bloomberg used his severance check to start his own company. Now he's one of the richest people in the country. Bloomberg was a partner at investment bank Salomon Brothers. In 1998, they were bought out by the company that eventually became Citigroup. Bloomberg was let go, but not before receiving a hefty severance check, he writes in his autobiography, Bloomberg by Bloomberg. He used that money to start his own financial services company, originally called Innovative Market Solutions. The company, eventually renamed Bloomberg LP, aimed to make it easier for traders to wade through data and was worth $2 billion by 1989. Today, the former New York City mayor is worth an estimated $38.4 billion, according to Forbes.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Jerry Seinfeld:</b> Walt Disney's newspaper editor told the aspiring cartoonist he wasn't creative enough. In 1919, Disney was fired from one of his first animation jobs at the Kansas City Star newspaper because his editor felt he "lacked imagination and had no good ideas," according to The Wisdom of Oz. That wasn't the last of his failures. Disney then acquired Laugh-O-Gram, an animation studio he later drove into bankruptcy. Finally, he decided to set his sights on a more profitable area: Hollywood. He and his brother moved to California and began the Disney Brothers' Studio, eventually creating Mickey Mouse and Disneyland and winning 22 Academy Awards.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Oprah Winfrey:</b> A Baltimore TV producer told Oprah Winfrey she was "unfit for television news." According to Become Your #1 Fan, Winfrey was fired from her evening news reporter gig with Baltimore's WJZ-TV because she got too emotionally invested in her stories. A Baltimore TV producer reportedly told her she was "unfit for television news." As a consolation, though, he offered her a role on a daytime TV show, People Are Talking. The show became a hit, and Winfrey stayed for eight years, according to Biography.com. Winfrey eventually became the host of The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired for 25 seasons. She's currently worth an estimated $3 billion, according to Forbes.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank:</b> Right before they started Home Depot, co-founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank were fired from their jobs.
Marcus and Blank were working for Southern Californian home-center chain, Handy Dan, when a corporate raider fired both of them, Entrepreneur reports. The two men decided to start their own home-improvement store based on an idea they'd had while at Handy Dan: an entire store of discounts. They called it Home Depot. In less than a decade, they'd opened more than 100 stores and made over $2.7 billion in sales. Handy Dan shut down in 1989..</li>

	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Colonel Sanders:</b> Colonel Harland Sanders was fired from dozens of jobs for his temper. According to KFC, Colonel Harland Sanders sold tires in the early 1920s and became the top salesman in Kentucky, but he was fired because of his temper. Time magazine reports that he was fired from dozens more jobs before closing his first restaurant and going broke at age 65. He was reportedly fired from two separate railroad jobs, once for insubordination and the other time for fighting a colleague, and as a country lawyer after assaulting his own client. After losing his restaurant, Sanders traveled across the U.S. looking for someone to sell his fried chicken. It wasn't until 1964, when Sanders was 74, that the Colonel had more than 600 franchised outlets for his chicken and he sold his interest in the company for $2 million to a group of investors, according to Biography.com.</li>

		 <div id="Section1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
			<ul class="w3-ul w3-card-4 w3-left-align">
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Avoid blame games:</b> Don't impulsively disparage your supervisor or blame co-workers or subordinates for your performance problems.This is a hard one if you think they helped cost you your job, but future employers will conduct thorough background checks and seek input from former colleagues at all levels. Any enemies that you’ve made with your departing comments will be more likely to share damaging information. Parting impressions can be lasting and might influence staff to view you as a negative person.  </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Understand Company's Decision :</b>Don't miss the opportunity to ask for the basis of your employer's decision.   If due process according to company policy has not been followed, you may be able to petition Human Resources to buy some additional time to improve any shortcomings you may have. Review this guide on your rights if your job is terminated. You might also have some protection through a personal contract, union agreement or anti-discrimination law. Consult a labor lawyer prior to finalizing your separation if you think you might have a case.<li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Grieve:</b> If there was ever a time to veg out and relax, this is it. It’s hard to job search if you’re filled with self-judgment, anger, or shame over being fired. Give yourself time to grieve the loss in its entirety—the daily routine that was familiar and comfortable, the interactions with former colleagues, and the sense of purpose or worth that your work gave you—even if it wasn’t your dream job. It’s a lot to take in. Permit yourself to process the complicated emotions. Maybe even allow yourself some time to sulk and feel sorry for yourself. Go ahead and let it out. You are hereby granted permission to get into sweats and be the antithesis of productive. But only for a limited time. After a couple of days, you’ve got to face the outside world again.</li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Don’t Compare and Despair:</b> It’s probably not an ideal time to be swiping through the “best-of” reels of everyone else’s life. Feeling envious or comparing yourself to all the gainfully employed, seemingly happy people in your Facebook feed won’t help you bounce back. In fact, if you compare your situation (arguably one of your lowest moments) to everyone else’s, you risk falling into deep despair, and that’s no way to move on and forward with your career.Take a social media breather for a while. Stop thinking about what everyone else is doing, and just focus on you. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Understand What Went Wrong : </b>Being fired for performance (even if you weren’t made privy to the precise problems in your exit conversation) means you probably have some things to work on. The question is, how aware are you of your shortcomings? Do your best to identify them and avoid carrying them over to what lies ahead. Start by re-reading all your employer reviews. Make note of the things you were praised for doing—you’ll want to take those with you to your next role. Consider too the development suggestions. What are they telling you? How could you have improved your performance?</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Ask for feedback: </b> Prepare for the job search ahead of you by soliciting an honest opinion of your skills and shortcomings from friends, mentors and former colleagues. If you have your old performance reviews, look them over to spot common themes. And if you were fired from your last job, then there’s a chance you received either a formal or informal warning from your supervisor.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Avoid panic: </b> While a moderate degree of anxiety has been consistently found to be a motivator, panic will only make the situation worse. No one makes good choices while in a state of panic and good opportunities can be lost during the panic period.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Avoid isolation: </b>  A wounded animal likes to be left alone to lick its wounds, and some people revert back to that instinctual pull when they are emotionally upset or damaged. However, to do so to the exclusion of everything else can be short-sighted. Although giving yourself time to reflect on the past and discover new directions for the future can be helpful after a job loss, this should not be done at the sacrifice of connections with loved ones, friends, and colleagues who can provide not only support at these times, but also fresh ideas and future job opportunities through their network of friends and colleagues</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Avoid "what ifs.": </b> Living in the past is not where your mind needs to be right now. Plus, "what ifs" are impossible to answer anyway. If money is not immediately critical, a positive reframe is to view being fired as an unexpected opportunity to focus on other equally important life matters, such as family, relationships, higher education, or extracurricular activities. If money is critical, focus on the future by exploring other career opportunities or a career change. Job terminations also can present opportunities to strengthen your self concept through introspection. Take the extra time you have to reexamine your life goals. This can be a good opportunity to open the door to the next chapter in your life.</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Don't Beat Yourself Up: </b> While acknowledging your feelings are important, it is vital not to criticize or blame yourself when you have lost your job and are unemployed. If you have been laid off without any fault of yours, instead of wallowing in self-pity and mulling over the reasons that led to you being fired, dispel any negative thought that comes to your mind. Every time any such thought crops up, challenge yourself to remove it from your mind.</li>

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>don't lose faith in yourself:</b>  A firing can be demoralizing but remember it is only one employer's decision, and there will be other, more suitable options for you. Take the time to regroup and find a job that is a better fit for you and your interests.  It may be that this wasn’t the right job for you and a push to find a new one is just what you needed to move along your career.  </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Understand grieving :</b>  Understand that you are grieving (or you will be, at some point) and that this is your own, unique divorce recovery path. Everyone grieves in their own way and in their own time. Some people recover from grief and resume normal activities within six months, though they continue to feel moments of sadness. Others may feel better after about a year, and sometimes people continue to grieve for years without seeming to improve or find relief even temporarily. Grief can be complicated by other conditions, most notably depression, or by the person’s level of dependency on the departed. <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="w3-button w3-transparent w3-display-right">&times;</span></li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Legal questions:</b> Maybe you are finished with the divorce but you must put a new will in place, or now, you’ve just been named Power of Attorney for your aging mother.Request all your files from your attorney(marriage license,  divorce decree). Now that your case is final, get all your paperwork back from your case. File away any bank or tax records or other paperwork you need to keep in your regular files.  Once you have it, file it away where you can’t see it. Just seeing the box of divorce paperwork can bring up emotions. Keep it out of sight until you decide you can safely shred the contents. Keep a copy of that with your divorce decree. If you plan on changing your name back to your maiden name, you might need the marriage license to establish the name change. Here’s a link on how to change your name after a divorce in California. <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="w3-button w3-transparent w3-display-right">&times;</span></li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Emotional concerns:</b> Is it the prospect of being alone? Is it how your divorce will hurt your kids?

	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Pick your battles: </b>While it's common to feel anger toward your former employer, taking legal action is viable only in certain cases.Paul Lopez, an employment attorney with the firm Tripp Scott, says he regularly receives calls from people seeking legal advice after being fired."A lot of people are fired simply because they didn't get along with their boss, and you can't sue a company because your boss was a jerk," Lopez says.However, certain circumstances can warrant legal action -- such as civil-rights violations."No one can be fired because of their sex, race, age, disability or national origin," says Lopez. "If there's a manager who has a prejudice against someone in those protected classes and fires them -- that's actionable."Dennis Nason, CEO of Nason & Nason, an executive recruitment firm, adds, "If you're thinking about suing your previous employer, unless you have a very strong case, it's not going to get you anywhere. My advice is to move on.".<span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="w3-button w3-transparent w3-display-right">&times;</span></li>

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Transition:</b> Don't refuse to help with the transition if some time will elapse prior to your termination date. By facilitating a smooth transition, you’ll be remembered as a better employee and may benefit by receiving positive recommendations and referrals.  Being nice, even when you’re in a bad situation, will help you in the long run.</li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Make a Corrective Action Plan :</b> Once you get feedback from your peers, figure out what you can do to improve performance issues you want to work on. Is there a class you can take to build a skill? Books you can read to help you deal more effectively with others? Podcasts or videos that will help untangle the issues that stymied you? Do you need coaching in a certain area, such as time management? Using difficult feedback to get back into a learning mode will boost your confidence as it shifts your focus from your loss to planning your next win.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Work Out:</b> If you think working out seems to be the go-to answer for improving any situation, well, you’d be right. Exercising and feeling strong are a boon to your mental wellness and will give you the charge you need to begin the job search.At a time like this, you want to do everything you can to move the odds squarely in your favor. Grab those kettle bells, go out for a run, or do daily push-ups, and notice how the physical exertion impacts your well-being. </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Write a Thank You Note:</b> To your former boss! As you come to terms with the devastating loss, hopefully, you’ll begin to see things more clearly. Maybe you’ll even conclude that your manager made the right decision for the company, and if not that exactly, then a decision that in the long run will prove good for you and your career path. Even if it takes swallowing some pride, send a note to your former supervisor, thanking her for the opportunity to work in the organization and offering your assistance should she ever need help in the future. You never know where she or you will end up, and it’s entirely possible that your professional paths will cross again. And at the end of the day, a simple note of gratitude will get you a lot further than burning bridges. </li>
