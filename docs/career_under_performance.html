<h4><b>What is underperformance?</b></h4>
      <h6><i>Underperformance or poor performance can be exhibited in the following ways:

    unsatisfactory work performance, that is, a failure to perform the duties of the position or to perform them to the standard required
    non-compliance with workplace policies, rules or procedures
    unacceptable behaviour in the workplace
    disruptive or negative behaviour that impacts on co-workers.

Underperformance is not the same as misconduct. Misconduct is very serious behaviour such as theft or assault which may warrant instant dismissal. In cases of misconduct employers should seek specific advice about how to proceed before taking any action
 It is important to understand the key drivers of performance or underperformance within the workforce. It is also important to correctly and specifically identify the problem. Some common reasons for underperformance are identified later in this guide</i></h6>

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Lack Of Incentives:</b> In his book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Daniel Pink highlights research confirming some incentives can cause significant impact on performance. The more "smarts" required by the employee, the more they can be negatively impacted by incentives. Managers need to look for three things: autonomy (let them make decisions), mastery (give opportunities for them to get better), and purpose (what is their "why?").   - Dean Miles, Bridgepoint Coaching & Strategy Group .</li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Poor Time Management Skills :</b>  Sometimes the smartest individuals have the poorest time management because they can get away with not planning much longer than most. Look not just to their talent but also to their skills in planning, prioritizing, delegating, etc. Then, see if there are ways you can help them strengthen their skills in the areas where they most need help so they can leverage their intelligence and not burn out.   - Elizabeth Saunders, Real Life E </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Overconfidence  :</b> Smart people sometimes tend to get overconfident in their abilities to get things done. They tend to believe they know it all and do not need any further education or input. They may decline soliciting others' opinions for the same reasons. Managers need to showcase everyone's strengths in a tactful way and help smart people understand that everyone has value to bring to the table.   - Gia Ganesh, Gia Ganesh Coaching </li>
    
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Unmotivated Or Uninspired :</b> When your smartest people are underperforming, it could be due to lack of inspiration. The head of the class can act out if they feel unchallenged or uninspired about the work. The wise leader will find them something bigger and more meaningful to do. Leadership includes inspiring those that work for you. Get to know the team better. Learn what creates motivation for your superstars.   - Doug Thorpe, Headway Exec </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Lack Of Purpose And Adventure Creates Boredom </b>Smart people deeply need to solve problems. In particular, solving problems to something they feel has a bigger purpose. Engagement and productivity is directly tied to taking on these adventures to create innovative solutions. Provide opportunities for them to do this, and you'll see the shift. Bonus: It inspires the whole team and creates a stronger service and product.   - Jen Kelchner, LDR21</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Not Feeling Heard:</b> An employee’s level of engagement usually parallels their performance. If one of your brightest employees is underperforming, it could be a sign that they feel like they’re not being heard, their work isn’t appreciated, or they’re not valued or respected as an individual. Managers who connect with employees on a personal level, recognizing their unique contributions, inspire high performance.   - Jody Michael, Jody Michael Associates </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Cultural Fit:</b> Unfortunately, smart employees are not always the best fit for an organization, a team, or a certain role. Research has consistently shown that high-fit employees will perform better, be more satisfied with their jobs, and more committed to their organizations. In addition to smarts, managers should consider how their employees' personality, values and needs align with their environment.   - Ross Blankenship, PhD, Bespoke Partners / bp|leadership </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Lack Of Challenges:</b> Many times, smart people underperform because they aren't being challenged. It's important for managers to get to know their employees' work style and interests. This will help them coach the person along so that they perform optimally.     - Venessa Marie Perry, Health Resource Solutions, LLC </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Un-engaged Management :</b> Gaining honest, actionable feedback can be highly effective in employee engagement and growth. Asking open-ended and insightful questions, ensure you are clear on what exactly they are saying, and make sure you have enough information to act upon what they have to say or to be able to explain why you cannot act. Finally, follow up to let them know their feedback is being considered or actioned.   - Lianne Lyne, PLP Coaching, LLC </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Too Many Tasks, Not Enough Prioritization  :</b>The smartest employees may be struggling with juggling too many tasks without being able to prioritize which ones come first. The desire to perform well and take on as many tasks as possible can actually deter employees from being able to properly excel in their role. I recommend meeting with the employee and helping them prioritize to increase their performance and allow them to shine.   - Wendi Weiner, JD, NCRW, CPRW, CCTC, CCM, The Writing Guru </li>

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Critical financial questions:</b>The employer should determine:

    how serious the problem is
    how long the problem has existed, and
    how wide the gap is between what is expected and what is being delivered.

Once the problem has been identified and assessed, the employer should organise a meeting with the employee to discuss the problem.

The employer should let the employee know the purpose of the meeting in advance so they can adequately prepare for the meeting.

The employee should be allowed to bring a support person of their choice or a union representative to the meeting. Employers working at best practice will inform the employee that they can bring a support person as a matter of process.</li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Effort. Am I putting enough time and energy into the work? :</b>  Understand that you are grieving (or you will be, at some point) and that this is your own, unique divorce recovery path. Everyone grieves in their own way and in their own time. Some people recover from grief and resume normal activities within six months, though they continue to feel moments of sadness. Others may feel better after about a year, and sometimes people continue to grieve for years without seeming to improve or find relief even temporarily. Grief can be complicated by other conditions, most notably depression, or by the person’s level of dependency on the departed. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Strategy. Am I working smartly rather than relying on routine?:</b> Maybe you are finished with the divorce but you must put a new will in place, or now, you’ve just been named Power of Attorney for your aging mother.Request all your files from your attorney(marriage license,  divorce decree). Now that your case is final, get all your paperwork back from your case. File away any bank or tax records or other paperwork you need to keep in your regular files.  Once you have it, file it away where you can’t see it. Just seeing the box of divorce paperwork can bring up emotions. Keep it out of sight until you decide you can safely shred the contents. Keep a copy of that with your divorce decree. If you plan on changing your name back to your maiden name, you might need the marriage license to establish the name change. Here’s a link on how to change your name after a divorce in California. </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Talent. Do I have the skills, knowledge, and capabilities to do my job well?:</b> Is it the prospect of being alone? Is it how your divorce will hurt your kids? Do you worry you might burn out your friends, because you sound like a whiny, broken record? Write these down. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Professional Help/Counselling : </b>What other professionals do you need to speak to, if not now, eventually? Who will teach you how to do things your mate used to do? </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Understand that divorce recovery takes time: </b>While nobody knows exactly how long (some researchers say 17 months, others insist it’s three to five years) we know that to advance through the divorce recovery process it requires intention.</li>

		</header>
		<div class="w3-container">
			<ul class="w3-ul w3-card-4 w3-left-align">
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Meet with the employee to discuss the problem :</b> It is important that the meeting takes place in private and in an environment that is comfortable and non-threatening, away from distractions and interruptions.

The employer should begin by holding a discussion with the employee to explain the problem in specific terms. From this conversation, the employee should be able to clearly understand:

    what the problem is
    why it is a problem
    how it impacts on the workplace, and
    why there is a concern.

The employer should discuss the outcomes they wish to achieve from the meeting.

The meeting should be an open discussion and the employee should have an opportunity to have their point of view heard and duly considered. The employer should listen to the explanation of why the problem has occurred or to any other comments the employee makes.

When having this type of meeting, it may be useful in facilitating discussion to refer to recent positive things that the employee has done to show them that you also recognise and appreciate their strengths.

Key points for employers to remember when holding the meeting are to:

    talk about the issue and not the person
    explore the reasons why there is an issue
    clarify details
    stay relaxed and encouraging, and
    summarise to check your understanding of the situation.

And, when discussing shortfalls in any area, it is important to check that the employee:

    is aware that it is a task that is required of them
    has been shown what is required,
    understands the gap between what is happening and what is required.

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Start a new hobby :</b>  I was going through a divorce, my writing hobby became obsessive. Every time I felt sad or depressed or angry or scared, I wrote about it. I ended up writing 3 novels in 2 years. It was crazy! But, I view that as a good thing. Delve into something you love and you will be fulfilled and happy, and too focused to think about the fact that you are alone. As long as the changes you make are healthy and constructive, these are very appropriate. “I started writing again. Writing is the essence of who I am but I lost that during my marriage. Writing blog posts helped me get my voice back. I went on to pen how-to articles for websites and eventually was writing for magazines, websites and even HuffPost! Now one of my goals is to enlighten and educate women so they feel empowered and not alone during the divorce process.”  — Beth Cone Kramer. Smart women make that mental shift from victim to survivor, and they take the necessary steps to get there fully.Pretending the divorce never happened or downplaying its importance. </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Get healthy:</b>  Try walking once a day, even if it’s just for 10 minutes outside. Walking reduces depression and lifts mood. Or try an exercise on demand app for your phone. I really enjoy the workouts on http://www.aaptiv.com/Aaptiv. They have treadmill, bike, yoga joggin, and strength training workouts led by trainers. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Connect with old friend(s):</b> Desperately trying anything to gain back the spouse (jealousy, a makeover, promises to never do something again, a vacation together, etc.). </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Forgive :</b> Forgiveness is about setting yourself free, not about the other person. You forgive and do not have to let the other person know that you did so, or even see him again. It is about cutting free any ties that bind you to certain situations or people and letting go of the past. Forgiveness severs the hurt and injustice that binds you both together. Forgiveness is just about letting go and not about getting revenge. Thoughts of revenge keep you connected to that person.	</li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Get organized:</b> he smartest women come to terms with the reduced lifestyle they have after divorce. They reaffirm their priorities or commit to changing their lifestyle. They do not rely on their ex-husband as their long-term financial solution, nor do they see “finding another man” as the solution.Smart women take charge of their finances during and after divorce. They hire a financial planner or an accountant to review and organize their finances and map out spending and goals for the next decade. Although daunting at first, this step is immensely empowering.Analyzing and replaying what happened over and over again in your mind isn’t going to help or change anything. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Cut-off negative voices :</b>Reach out to those who support you and ‘unfriend’ or step back from the naysayers. people who bring your mood down with their pessimism, anxiety, and general sense of distrust. One obvious solution is to walk away from them. you may have to take time away from the negative person on a regular basis to maintain your composure. Of course, if you do take time away from them, it would be important to come up with an appropriate “cover story” for it—you don’t want the negative person to feel that you are avoiding her.  </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Face your loneliness:</b> Time to get back into that mindset, you will never be alone if you have family and friends who love you. Being alone doesn't mean being isolated and never seeing anyone. It just means not being coupled up, or in a rush to do so.

Society is much more accepting of singles than even a decade ago,Analyzing and replaying what happened over and over again in your mind isn’t going to help or change anything. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Look for Meet Up or support groups for like-minded people: </b> I made friends with other people who were divorced or in the process of divorce. You don’t have to leave your old friends behind post-split but there are just some things that your married friends won’t understand.Find Facebook support groups for women going through a divorce. Are you a part of the Round and Round Rosie Facebook page? You’ll find support and positive thoughts from lots of women who are going through a divorce too. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Live. Explore. Try things on:</b>  I like the sound of a “life list” much better than a “bucket list.” Don’t think too much but jot down a list of places you want to go, new hobbies to try, movies you want to see, experiences you want to do. Keep this document on your phone and on your laptop so you can see it quickly. Change it often so it reflects where you are now. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Open your eyes to new adventures and friends:</b> Analyzing and replaying what happened over and over again in your mind isn’t going to help or change anything. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Do things alone:</b> Part of your grieving is being alone with yourself and rediscovering you. Welcome chances to dine out alone, travel alone, see movies alone… this is part of understanding the difference between what it is to be lonely vs. alone and being okay with that.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Stretch yourself:</b>The divorce certainly took you out of your comfort zone in a not so pleasant way, so why not seek ways to stretch yourself that are more fun? Go master the Tango by Air BnB’ing it in Buenos Aires! Go skydiving! Or buy the pickup truck you’ve always wanted and head fly-fishing. Just go.They take inventory of their life, mistakes and all, and devote time and energy to discovering who they are and what they want for their future. This process takes time, patience and dedication, but in the end, these women are able to put their divorce behind them.  </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Allow yourself to trust again:</b> This can be a tough part of your divorce recovery, because surely you’ve been disappointed, hurt, or even crushed along the way. But as you take these steps, you will feel better. You will meet good people and realize that you are able to trust again. You may even open your heart to love again.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Join support group or counselling: </b> Analyzing and replaying what happened over and over again in your mind isn’t going to help or change anything. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Get a new email address/social account:</b> You’ll want to begin creating a new online life for yourself, if your old email has your old last name or you shared the email with other family members, get a new gmail email account. </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Find a good therapist/Counsellor : </b>Try an online therapist! Therapy was truly a life saver during the toughest parts of my divorce. I still want to work on some issues from this difficult life transition so I’m still in therapy, BUT I’m now using Talkspace. It’s an online therapy app that I’m finding is extremely effective, reasonably priced and easy to use. I communicate with my therapist via an app and leave texts or recorded messages. We also do video sessions once a month. I’ve found it to be a wonderful way to do therapy. </li>

    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Denial:</b>Where possible, it is important that a solution is jointly devised with the employee. An employee who has contributed to the solution will be more likely to accept and act on it.

When working out a solution, the employer should:

    explore ideas by asking open questions
    emphasise common ground
    keep the discussion on track
    focus on positive possibilities, and
    offer assistance, such as further training, mentoring, flexible work practices or redefining roles and expectations.

A clear plan of action should be developed with the employee to implement the solution. This can be in the form of a performance agreement or action plan. A performance agreement or action plan can:

    reflect an understanding of performance expectations and what is to be achieved over the specified time period (performance improvement milestones)
    clarify roles and responsibilities of the employee
    include strategies for training and career development
    include timeframes for improvement (these may vary depending on the issue and needs of the business, however it is important to give an employee adequate time to improve their performance)
    reinforce the value and worth of the role being performed.

A date should be set for another meeting with the employee to review progress and discuss the employee's performance against the agreed action plan.

The employer should keep a written record of all discussions relating to underperformance in case further action is required. Generally, it may also be used as evidence if legal action is taken about the matter.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"> <b>Bargaining:</b> Desperately trying anything to gain back the spouse (jealousy, a makeover, promises to never do something again, a vacation together, etc.).It can be because of wanting to avoid the loneliness and sadness that accompanies the divorce, avoiding the stigma that society has regarding divorce, as well as all the gossip that goes with it, wanting to preserve the family because of the children, and avoiding going through all the hassle of the legal and emotional aspects of divorce.

Though bargaining may sound like a very desperate thing to do, experiencing it as one of the stages of grief in divorce is normal. 

This is because even if we know that the divorce is real, human as we are, we still hold on to the hope that everything can get back to normal, that everything can still be restored. </li>
    <li class="w3-display-container"><b>Finding a new person too soon/Hookups:</b> If you try to find someone new before getting complete with your divorce grief it could end up hurting you in the long run. Going right out on the hunt again feels good for a while, but bigger problems arise in the new relationship, because you weren't ready and you got into it for the wrong reasons," Tessina says. "To really feel better, you have to face your own responsibility in past relationships that didn't work, make changes and begin having relationships on a brand new basis."Rebound sex can be fun, sure, but it isn't all about you. There's another person in the mix with feelings too — so be sensitive and compassionate for both your sakes so no one gets hurt. "Remember that whomever you sleep with is human, and they have feelings which may bite you in the long run. If you jump into a rebound relationship, you're just masking your pain with the excitement of a new love. If you don't have time to grieve and recover, problems will arise. You need a while after you end this current relationship to evaluate what happened, be on your own and get ready to be with someone else. Otherwise, you'll create a trail of rebound destruction. Do you think it’s possible to replace the love you shared with someone else? It’s not.  Relationships are unique, so you can never replace someone you love. It’s not like replacing a car battery or old tennis shoes.  If you try to find someone new before getting complete with your divorce grief it could end up hurting you in the long run.  </li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Avoid self-destructive behaviors</b>Continuing improper sleeping and eating habits. Divorce can make for a very stressful time in our lives. With stress comes poor sleep. Sleep helps to restore balance to the body and mind. It regulates chemical processes and produces melatonin, a chemical that helps us heal. Sleep also resets the brain, allowing it to create new memories and learn new things </li>
	
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Don’t Intellectualize Your Divorce:</b> Analyzing and replaying what happened over and over again in your mind isn’t going to help or change anything.Divorce hurts. It doesn’t matter if you initiated it or had no idea it was coming. Some people use the reason for their divorce as justification as to why they shouldn’t feel sad about it.If you “analyze” your painful past memories and trace it to your abusive childhood, do the memories show gratitude to your “aha” moments by never coming back again? If you “argue” with your mind that its obsessions and compulsions are faulty, does it stop creating them? Probably not. If they did, intellectualization would be classified as a “treatment” and not a “defense mechanism”. When a relationship ends, we may spend countless hours dissecting countless situations in an attempt to discover what went wrong. Our minds act like detectives, revisiting scenes and hypothetical situations to find clues and witnesses that attest to what caused the relationship’s end. We recruit friends to become therapists, as we relentlessly analyze our feelings about the one who is no longer a part of our lives. The hours we spend examining and re-examining the past are part of the healing process, but overdoing it can prevent us from living in the present and moving toward the future. Instead of spending hours trying to understand why a relationship ended, we can spend some of that time better understanding who we are without that person in our lives.</li>
	<li class="w3-display-container"><b>Social media:</b> Your divorce doesn’t have to be all over Social Media and Facebook doesn’t need to notify you about your Ex. If you can't or don't want to stop or suspend use of social media, don't post anything negative about the other parent or other family members. Nothing disparaging. Nothing derogatory. Don't use social media to vent. Monitor the comments of your family as well. They can be on your side, but they shouldn't attack your child's other parent. Things said online can not be unsaid. What would your children think if they saw what you wrote about their beloved mom or dad? Think about now and also many years from now.avoid disparaging your partner on social media or using your Facebook page to vent about your relationship.
